<h2 id="Project-Title-Understanding-AT2018cow-An-Exploration-of-Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations-QPOs"><a href="#Project-Title-Understanding-AT2018cow-An-Exploration-of-Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations-QPOs" class="headerlink" title="Project Title: Understanding AT2018cow - An Exploration of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)"></a>Project Title: Understanding AT2018cow - An Exploration of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)</h2><h3 id="Abstract-1"><a href="#Abstract-1" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>AT2018cow, a fast-rising blue optical transient with peculiar properties, has captivated the attention of astrophysicists as it may represent a new and unique astrophysical phenomenon. Despite extensive studies, its classification has remained elusive. In this comprehensive research endeavor, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation technique and a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to delve into the enigmatic nature of AT2018cow.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Findings-1"><a href="#Key-Findings-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Findings"></a>Key Findings</h3><p>Our research unveiled the following significant findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>QPOs:</strong> Through meticulous analysis, we discovered compelling evidence for 4-day quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) extending from optical to X-ray wavelengths within AT2018cow. The presence of these QPOs was robustly supported by Monte Carlo simulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Amplified Power:</strong> By combining optical and X-ray light curves, we observed a substantial amplification of power associated with the QPOs, signifying their profound significance in the understanding of AT2018cow’s behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Zero Time Lag Correlation:</strong> Perhaps the most intriguing discovery was the zero time lag correlation of QPOs at different wavelengths. This correlation proved to be independent of light curve detrending models, marking a distinctive characteristic of AT2018cow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unique Nature:</strong> The quasi-periodicities observed in AT2018cow defied conventional explanations, as they were not attributed to noise with Fast Fourier Transform analysis. This uniqueness indicated that AT2018cow belonged to a distinct class of transients.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accreting Black Hole System:</strong> Building on the 4-day periodicity and the observational properties of AT2018cow, our analysis strongly suggested that AT2018cow is an accreting black hole system, marking a significant breakthrough in its classification.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global Lense-Thirring Precession:</strong> An exploration into the zero time lag quasi-periodicities led to the hypothesis that these phenomena could be attributed to global Lense-Thirring precession. A simplified model was developed to constrain the dimensionless spin parameter (a*) for the black hole in AT2018cow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fundamental Insights:</strong> This exploratory study unveiled the potential of Lense-Thirring precession as an interpretation of quasi-periodicities in accreting black hole transients. The presence of quasi-periodicity thus encodes valuable information about the fundamental properties of black holes.</p>

<li>ASASSN-18bt, discovered in the K2 Campaign 16 field, stands out as the nearest and brightest Supernova Ia observed by the Kepler spacecraft.</li>
<li>An unprecedented K2 early-time light curve with a 30-minute cadence revealed an atypical behavior characterized by a nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise.</li>
<li>The data hinted at a double-power-law model, challenging existing models related to companion interactions and suggesting the need for further theoretical work.</li>
<li>Swift X-ray nondetections provided insights into circumstellar material (CSM) at significant distances and densities, influencing our understanding of the progenitor system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paper 2: Unveiling the Two-Component Nature of SN 2018oh</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed analysis of SN 2018oh’s early-time light curve, starting weeks before the explosion, presented a unique two-component shape, distinct from typical Supernova Ia behavior.</li>
<li>The flux exhibited a steep linear gradient for the initial days, followed by a quadratic rise, with a “flux excess” relative to canonical SN Ia behavior.</li>
<li>Early color measurements indicated the possibility of a companion interaction, contributing to the flux excess.</li>
<li>The study emphasized the need for additional modeling and observations to provide stronger support for a single-degenerate progenitor system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paper 3: Unraveling the Spectroscopy of SN 2018oh</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SN 2018oh, the first spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova observed in the Kepler field, exhibited an excess emission in its early light curve.</li>
<li>Photometric evolution analysis revealed relatively normal behavior, with a rise time and ?m 15(B) consistent with typical Supernova Ia.</li>
<li>Notably, SN 2018oh displayed bluer B - V colors during the early epochs.</li>
<li>Extensive optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry, along with dense optical spectra, were instrumental in unraveling the spectral evolution of this unique supernova.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three papers collectively contribute to our understanding of Supernova SN 2018oh, shedding light on its atypical behavior and challenging conventional models. This project highlights the significance of well-sampled data and the need for continued research to unveil the mysteries of Supernova origins.</p>

<h2 id="Project-Title-GRB-SNe-and-Cosmology-Probing-Cosmological-Parameters-with-Gamma-Ray-Burst-Supernovae"><a href="#Project-Title-GRB-SNe-and-Cosmology-Probing-Cosmological-Parameters-with-Gamma-Ray-Burst-Supernovae" class="headerlink" title="Project Title: GRB-SNe and Cosmology - Probing Cosmological Parameters with Gamma-Ray Burst Supernovae"></a>Project Title: GRB-SNe and Cosmology - Probing Cosmological Parameters with Gamma-Ray Burst Supernovae</h2><h3 id="Abstract-3"><a href="#Abstract-3" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>This project explores the potential of Gamma-Ray Burst Supernovae (GRB-SNe) as standardizable candles to measure distances in the universe and constrain cosmological parameters. It encompasses two significant papers, one of which was highlighted by Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine, providing a pioneering exploration of the utility of GRB-SNe in cosmological studies.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 1: First Quantitative Constraints on Cosmological Parameters with GRB-SNe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study aimed to extend the scope of cosmological parameter constraints beyond traditional standard candles like Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia), which exhibit limitations at high redshifts (z &gt; 1.5).</li>
<li>Employing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique, this paper achieved a milestone by providing the first quantitative constraint on cosmological parameters using a sample of GRB-SNe.</li>
<li>The exploratory study indirectly detected the existence of dark energy (??), indicating the potential of GRB-SNe as standardizable candles for high-redshift measurements and cosmological parameter constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paper 2: Building a Standard Procedure Pipeline for GRB-SNe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The transformation of any astrophysical event into a standard candle relies on the ability to measure peak magnitudes and decline rates.</li>
<li>This paper tackled the challenge of establishing GRB-SNe as standardizable candles by developing a standard procedure pipeline to obtain their light curves.</li>
<li>The pipeline accounted for various effects, including afterglow brightness, host galaxy brightness, and extinction, ensuring accurate measurements.</li>
<li>Additionally, K-correction templates were created to convert observed bands into the rest-frame V band, allowing for standardized comparisons.</li>
<li>By applying the standard procedure pipeline, rest-frame V-band light curves of eight GRB-SNe were obtained, revealing that GRB-SNe exhibit fairly uniform peak luminosities.</li>
<li>Importantly, GRB-SNe demonstrated a luminosity-decline rate relation akin to the Phillips relation established for SNe Ia. This relation, which is tighter than the k-s relation, offers a new constraint on GRB explosion models.</li>
<li>The study found that the peak luminosities of GRB-SNe are weakly correlated with the peak times of their light curves, presenting an alternative standardizable candle for cosmological distance measurements and cosmological parameter constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Results:</strong><br>These two papers collectively lay the groundwork for considering GRB-SNe as an alternative to traditional SNe Ia for measuring cosmological distances and constraining cosmological parameters. The luminosity-decline rate relation and the standard procedure pipeline developed in this project offer new avenues for exploring the universe’s vast mysteries.</p>
