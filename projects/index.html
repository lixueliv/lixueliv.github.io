<h2 id="Project-Title-Unveiling-the-Dynamics-of-Online-Expression-A-Study-of-Chinese-Netizen-Speech"><a href="#Project-Title-Unveiling-the-Dynamics-of-Online-Expression-A-Study-of-Chinese-Netizen-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Project Title: Unveiling the Dynamics of Online Expression - A Study of Chinese Netizen Speech"></a>Project Title: Unveiling the Dynamics of Online Expression - A Study of Chinese Netizen Speech</h2><h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>Our comprehensive study aims to illuminate the intricacies of online expression among Chinese netizens. We have delved into the interactions, censorship, and the repercussions of government control on the digital voices of Chinese citizens. The investigation spans the period from January 2019 to February 2023, encompassing the virtual landscape of Weibo, often referred to as the Chinese Twitter. </p>
<h3 id="Key-Findings"><a href="#Key-Findings" class="headerlink" title="Key Findings"></a>Key Findings</h3><p>Our research has yielded a series of significant insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Resonant ‘Silent Majority’:</strong> In contrast to conventional perceptions of a silent majority, our findings reveal that these individuals are far from silent in the digital realm. Chinese netizens engage actively, providing valuable insights into their perspectives and opinions on a wide array of subjects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Enigma of Censorship:</strong> Our research has unveiled the extensive scope of online censorship and content removal. Remarkably, nearly 75% of comments made by netizens faced censorship and deletion, primarily orchestrated under the purview of prominent Chinese official accounts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strategic Censorship:</strong> A distinctive pattern of selective censorship has emerged. Posts that garnered high levels of engagement from ordinary Chinese citizens were particularly susceptible to censorship, reflecting a concerted effort to manage discussions with elevated public participation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Domestic Affairs at the Center:</strong> A prevailing point of focus among Chinese netizens was domestic affairs. Their active involvement in conversations pertaining to daily life issues signifies a strong connection to topics directly impacting their immediate environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>International Discord:</strong> Approximately 0.7% of posts were entirely restricted from receiving comments, with 13% of these posts revolving around international affairs. This significant proportion suggests marked differences in viewpoints between Chinese citizens and Chinese authorities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Forbidden Keywords:</strong> Notably, the two most “forbidden” keywords  led to the restriction of commenting on over 78% of relevant posts, aligning closely with subjects on which ordinary Chinese individuals were most vocal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As our analysis unveils the dynamics of online censorship, it becomes increasingly apparent that this control mechanism serves as a critical barometer. It reflects the evolving relationship between the Chinese government and ordinary citizens. The growing disparities between the two constituencies signal a potentially turbulent societal future. Censorship transcends its role as an instrument of control to become a vital indicator, illuminating the government’s regulatory approach and the unspoken sentiments of the populace, while offering predictive insights into future societal trends.</p>

<h2 id="Project-Title-Understanding-AT2018cow-An-Exploration-of-Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations-QPOs"><a href="#Project-Title-Understanding-AT2018cow-An-Exploration-of-Quasi-Periodic-Oscillations-QPOs" class="headerlink" title="Project Title: Understanding AT2018cow - An Exploration of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)"></a>Project Title: Understanding AT2018cow - An Exploration of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs)</h2><h3 id="Abstract-1"><a href="#Abstract-1" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>AT2018cow, a rapidly rising blue optical transient with peculiar properties, has captivated the attention of astrophysicists as it may represent a new and unique astrophysical phenomenon. Despite extensive studies, its classification has remained elusive. In this comprehensive research endeavor, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation technique and a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to delve into the enigmatic nature of AT2018cow.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Findings-1"><a href="#Key-Findings-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Findings"></a>Key Findings</h3><p>Our research unveiled the following significant findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>QPOs:</strong> Through meticulous analysis, we discovered compelling evidence for 4-day quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) extending from optical to X-ray wavelengths within AT2018cow. The presence of these QPOs was robustly supported by Monte Carlo simulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Amplified Power:</strong> By combining optical and X-ray light curves, we observed a substantial amplification of power associated with the QPOs, signifying their profound significance in the understanding of AT2018cow’s behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Zero Time Lag Correlation:</strong> Perhaps the most intriguing discovery was the zero time lag correlation of QPOs at different wavelengths. This correlation proved to be independent of light curve detrending models, marking a distinctive characteristic of AT2018cow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unique Nature:</strong> The quasi-periodicities observed in AT2018cow defied conventional explanations, as they were not attributed to noise with Fast Fourier Transform analysis. This uniqueness indicated that AT2018cow belonged to a distinct class of transients.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accreting Black Hole System:</strong> Building on the 4-day periodicity and the observational properties of AT2018cow, our analysis strongly suggested that AT2018cow is an accreting black hole system, marking a significant breakthrough in its classification.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global Lense-Thirring Precession:</strong> An exploration into the zero time lag quasi-periodicities led to the hypothesis that these phenomena could be attributed to global Lense-Thirring precession. A simplified model was developed to constrain the dimensionless spin parameter (a*) for the black hole in AT2018cow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fundamental Insights:</strong> This exploratory study unveiled the potential of Lense-Thirring precession as an interpretation of quasi-periodicities in accreting black hole transients. The presence of quasi-periodicity thus encodes valuable information about the fundamental properties of black holes.</p>

<li>Early color measurements indicated the possibility of a companion interaction, contributing to the flux excess.</li>
<li>The study emphasized the need for additional modeling and observations to provide stronger support for a single-degenerate progenitor system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paper 3: Unraveling the Spectroscopy of SN 2018oh</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SN 2018oh, the first spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova observed in the Kepler field, exhibited an excess emission in its early light curve.</li>
<li>Photometric evolution analysis revealed relatively normal behavior, with a rise time and   decline rate   consistent with typical Supernova Ia.</li>
<li>Notably, SN 2018oh displayed bluer B - V colors during the early epochs.</li>
<li>Extensive optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared photometry, along with dense optical spectra, were instrumental in unraveling the spectral evolution of this unique supernova.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three papers collectively contribute to our understanding of Supernova SN 2018oh, shedding light on its atypical behavior and challenging conventional models. This project highlights the significance of well-sampled data and the need for continued research to unveil the mysteries of Supernova origins.</p>

It encompasses two significant papers, one of which was highlighted by Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine, providing a pioneering exploration of the utility of GRB-SNe in cosmological studies.</p>
<p><strong>Paper 1: First Quantitative Constraints on Cosmological Parameters with GRB-SNe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study aimed to extend the scope of cosmological parameter constraints beyond traditional standard candles like Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia), which exhibit limitations at high redshifts (z &gt; 1.5).</li>
<li>Employing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique, this paper achieved a milestone by providing the first quantitative constraint on cosmological parameters using a sample of GRB-SNe.</li>
<li>The exploratory study indirectly detected the existence of dark energy, indicating the potential of GRB-S-SNe as standardizable candles for high-redshift measurements and cosmological parameter constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paper 2: Building a Standard Procedure Pipeline for GRB-SNe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The transformation of any astrophysical event into a standard candle relies on the ability to measure peak magnitudes and decline rates.</li>
<li>This paper tackled the challenge of establishing GRB-SNe as standardizable candles by developing a standard procedure pipeline to obtain their light curves.</li>
<li>The pipeline accounted for various effects, including afterglow brightness, host galaxy brightness, and extinction, ensuring accurate measurements.</li>
<li>Additionally, K-correction templates were created to convert observed bands into the rest-frame V band, allowing for standardized comparisons.</li>
<li>By applying the standard procedure pipeline, rest-frame V-band light curves of eight GRB-SNe were obtained, revealing that GRB-SNe exhibit fairly uniform peak luminosities.</li>
<li>Importantly, GRB-SNe demonstrated a luminosity-decline rate relation akin to the Phillips relation established for SNe Ia. This relation, which is tighter than the k-s relation, offers a new constraint on GRB explosion models.</li>
<li>The study found that the peak luminosities of GRB-SNe are weakly correlated with the peak times of their light curves, presenting an alternative standardizable candle for cosmological distance measurements and cosmological parameter constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Results:</strong><br>These two papers collectively lay the groundwork for considering GRB-SNe as an alternative to traditional SNe Ia for measuring cosmological distances and constraining cosmological parameters. The luminosity-decline rate relation and the standard procedure pipeline developed in this project offer new avenues for exploring the universe’s vast mysteries.</p>
