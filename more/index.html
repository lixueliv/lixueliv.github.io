<h3 id="Philanthropic-Endeavors"><a href="#Philanthropic-Endeavors" class="headerlink" title="Philanthropic Endeavors"></a>Philanthropic Endeavors</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Monthly Donations:</strong> While my bank account may not be as deep as a billionaire’s, I firmly believe that even modest contributions can make a world of difference. Every month, I donate to various causes, channeling my inner superhero to help critically ill children, support struggling elderly folks, and assist underserved communities. Who knew that saving the world could fit within my budget?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Educational Sponsorship:</strong> I may not be funding entire university buildings (yet), but I’m investing in the future. I support two bright high school students in their quest for higher education. They’re my academic apprentices, and I’m their Yoda, guiding them towards a brighter future.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Volunteer Work:</strong> In my college days, I volunteered for Dalian Charity. My superpower? Collecting trash from parks! As the Trashinator, I kept the city clean, all while training new recruits in the art of garbage collection. Sometimes, you have to get your hands dirty for a cleaner world.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting Spiritual Spaces:</strong> I believe in supporting spiritual spaces, even though I don’t have a personal hotline to the heavens. My donations help keep the temples going, showing that charity isn’t limited to any specific belief system. Besides, if the universe is taking notes, maybe it will help me earn a bit more for my philanthropic efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all seriousness, these endeavors are my way of giving back, even on a researcher’s budget. I’m on a mission to make the world a better place, one small donation at a time, and who knows, maybe it’s also the engine for me to earn more so I can do even more good.</p>

<h3 id="Taiji-Adventures-A-Comedy-of-Life-Lessons"><a href="#Taiji-Adventures-A-Comedy-of-Life-Lessons" class="headerlink" title="Taiji Adventures: A Comedy of Life Lessons"></a>Taiji Adventures: A Comedy of Life Lessons</h3><p>My journey into the world of Taiji is a bit like a sitcom. It all began with a book, a rather magical one. You see, my father, when he was a young, wide-eyed laborer, extended a helping hand to an elderly gentleman (the details remain a bit hazy, but it might have involved a life-saving act). As a token of appreciation, this sage elder presented my dad with a book whose title could be loosely translated as ‘The Eight Brocades.’  The old man’s advice? Learning from this book would gift him with good health and vitality. Little did I know, this would be the catalyst for my own Taiji escapades.</p>
<p>When I entered college, I was introduced to the world of Taiji as part of a quirky tradition. Unlike the typical college scenes you see in movies, we weren’t practicing for a competition or prepping for epic kung fu battles. No, our Taiji journey was all about the practice itself, and of course, keeping ourselves in good health. The most epic battles we fought were against stress, deadlines, and the eternal student nemesis, cafeteria food.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the catch: I practice Taiji, but I must admit it’s been a bit irregular. So, what’s the result of my sporadic Taiji adventures? Well, let’s just say my Taiji moves are like that catchy pop song you can’t quite remember ? it’s all in bits and pieces, and I definitely need some quality time to rehearse the entire track. </p>
<p>But hey, isn’t that what life is all about? It’s a bit of a comedy, full of twists, turns, and the occasional Taiji practice session. And who knows, maybe my inner Taiji master is just waiting for the perfect sitcom moment to shine!</p>

<h3 id="Jogging-and-Climbing"><a href="#Jogging-and-Climbing" class="headerlink" title="Jogging and Climbing"></a>Jogging and Climbing</h3><p>Once upon a time, I was the self-proclaimed king of jogging and climbing, conquering peaks and pounding the pavement with gusto. These activities not only kept me in great physical shape but also provided a refreshing mental break from the chaos of daily life.</p>
<p>But then, as life often does, it threw me a curveball. No, it wasn’t due to any virus; I’m fully recovered and feeling better than ever. Instead, I decided to take it easy and embrace the joy of relaxation for a while. You see, I got a bit lax with my jogging routine, and, well, it resulted in some extra pounds. &#128516;</p>
<p>Now, speaking of the sun, if you’re curious about the outcome of my previous love affair with sunlight, you can check out this photo of my face turning various shades of brown!<br><img src="/img/brown.jpg" alt="Photo"> </p>
<p>So, as I continue my jogging and climbing escapades, let’s hope for fewer face-to-face encounters with the sun!</p>

<h3 id="Cooking"><a href="#Cooking" class="headerlink" title="Cooking"></a>Cooking</h3><p>Cooking has always been a flavorful chapter in my life, filled with anecdotes and cherished family traditions. When I was a little girl, Chinese New Year meant lively family gatherings, where cousins and aunties would congregate for a grand feast. Amidst the plethora of dishes, my mom’s salad reigned supreme, always disappearing faster than you could say “yum.” My mom’s salad secrets? Well, they’re almost as well-guarded as a treasure map.</p>
<p>But, wait, there’s more! My father is the grandmaster of hot dishes, especially when it comes to cooking vegetables. He’s a magician in the kitchen, turning simple ingredients into culinary wonders that not only taste fantastic but also keep the nutrition intact.</p>
<p>So, I’ve inherited the love for cooking, both in traditional and experimental ways. Sadly, my busy schedule means I don’t get to cook as often as I’d like. But when I do, it’s a culinary journey filled with delicious twists and mouthwatering surprises. Perhaps, one day, I’ll unveil the ultimate salad recipe or create a hot dish so good it’d even impress my family! &#128516; &#127869; </p>

<p><a id="beliefs"></a></p>
<h3 id="Beliefs"><a href="#Beliefs" class="headerlink" title="Beliefs"></a>Beliefs</h3><p>I may not hold strong religious beliefs, but I deeply resonate with the philosophies of Buddhism and Taoism. These ancient teachings offer profound wisdom that guides me in navigating life’s challenges with serenity and grace.</p>
<p>Both Buddhism and Taoism emphasize finding happiness, comfort, and inner calm, even in the face of adversity. Their teachings remind me to embrace life with an open heart and a tranquil mind.</p>
<p>Discover the joy of music influenced by Buddhism and enriched with the spirit of Taoism, and kindly pardon my weird taste of music:  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMhj5qz4v4g">(link)</a>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjXaEtX92MA">(link)</a></p>
